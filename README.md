# AtlasBotCore
AtlasBot is a multi purpose gaming Discord Bot focussing on modularity and adapting to the demands of server owners.

# Invite the bot
The bot is currently for private use only as modules are disabled by default for some the use in the current server. Please feel free to DM Bort#9703 on Discord to request access to the bot.

# Command list
Coming soon

# Website
AtlasBot will have a website where users are able to more easily modify their settings and monitor their usage on the server.

# Tracking & Privacy
AtlasBot currently does not track any user data. The only data that is planned to be tracked is the frequency of commands used (what are the popular commands?) and how many users/servers have used the bot.
We are not and will never be logging user messages or other moderation activity.

# Servers
AtlasBot is planned to have a build in server browser once it is at a full public release. For now here is a list of servers that implemented AltasBot:
- Team Liquid
- Atlas Discord Server
